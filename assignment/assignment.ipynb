        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  - This paper is about methods and advtanges of data tidying.\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  - \"Tidy data standard\" intended to provide a standard way to organize data within a dataset, to faciliate the inital data exploration process, and simplify the development of data analysis tools.\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "  - Tidy datasets are standardized in uniform format, whereas messy datasets are not organized under standard rules.\n",
        "  - Variables, for example, could be height and width. But they could be treated as observations of varible \"dimension\".\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  - Values are usually either a number or a string. They are belongs to a variable and an observation.\n",
        "  - A variable contains all values that measure the same attribute across units.\n",
        "  - An observation contains all values that measure the same units across attributes.\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  - In Tidy data:\n",
        "- each variable forms a column\n",
        "- each observation forms a row\n",
        "- each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "  - 5 problems:\n",
        "- column headers are values not variable names\n",
        "- multiple variables are stored in the same column\n",
        "- variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "- multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "- a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables\n",
        "  - Table 4: column headers are values not variable names; variables are stored in rows\n",
        "  - Melting a dataset is to turn columns into rows\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  - Table 11 is messy because multiple types are stored in one table.\n",
        "  - Table 12A is molten because it turns column for each possible day as value under variable date. Table 12B is tidy because after turning element types into variables, each row now represents measurements for a single day.\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  - If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data.\n",
        "  - He hopes others will build on this framework to develop even better data storage strtegies and better tools."
